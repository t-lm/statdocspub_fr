THIS IS A CHANGE

run local:
- mkdocs serve

build:
- mkdocs build

deploy to github (this is immediate):
- mkdocs gh-deploy

theme:
- material
- https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-colors/
- styling, navigation ...

routing:
- site by default published on github pages: t-lm.github.io
- rerouting to an url is possible with dns record needs to be saved on route53: help_en.gostatit.com
- i don't think international routing works very well with mkdocs/ github pages
